                <p>React has been designed from the start for gradual adoption, and you can use as little
                    or as
                    much React as you need. Whether you want to get a taste of React, add some interactivity to a simple
                    HTML page, or start a complex React-powered app, the links in this section will help you get
                    started.

            <div id="redux" class="text-block text-block--redux">
                <p>Redux helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different
                    environments
                    (client, server, and native), and are easy to test.Centralizing your application's state and logic
                    enables powerful capabilities like undo/redo, state persistence, and much more.Redux works with any
                    UI
                    layer, and has a large ecosystem of addons to fit your needs.

            <div id="saga" class="text-block text-block--saga">
                <p>redux-saga is a library that aims to make application side effects (i.e. asynchronous
                    things
                    like data fetching and impure things like accessing the browser cache) easier to manage, more
                    efficient
                    to execute, easy to test, and better at handling failures.

                    The mental model is that a saga is like a separate thread in your application that's solely
                    responsible
                    for side effects. redux-saga is a redux middleware, which means this thread can be started, paused
                    and
                    cancelled from the main application with normal redux actions, it has access to the full redux
                    application state and it can dispatch redux actions as well.

                    It uses an ES6 feature called Generators to make those asynchronous flows easy to read, write and
                    test.
                    (if you're not familiar with them here are some introductory links) By doing so, these asynchronous
                    flows look like your standard synchronous JavaScript code. (kind of like async/await, but generators
                    have a few more awesome features we need)

                    You might've used redux-thunk before to handle your data fetching. Contrary to redux thunk, you
                    don't
                    end up in callback hell, you can test your asynchronous flows easily and your actions stay pure.

            <div id="git" class="text-block text-block--git">
                <p>Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle
                    everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

                    Git is easy to learn and has a tiny footprint with lightning fast performance. It outclasses SCM
                    tools
                    like Subversion, CVS, Perforce, and ClearCase with features like cheap local branching, convenient
                    staging areas, and multiple workflows.</p>
